We're excited to announce the launch of the Alliance for Resilient Computing Munich (ARC Munich), a community-driven initiative focused on dual-use technology development and innovation.

## Our Mission

ARC Munich brings together researchers, engineers, and technologists interested in developing cutting-edge solutions that serve both civilian and defense applications. We believe in:

- **Open Collaboration**: Building technology in the open, with the community
- **Practical Impact**: Focusing on projects that can make a real difference
- **Technical Excellence**: Maintaining high standards in our work
- **Dual-Use Innovation**: Creating solutions that benefit multiple sectors

## What We Do

Our focus areas span several critical technology domains:

### Autonomous Systems
We're developing benchmarks and evaluation methodologies for autonomous systems, including robotics, drones, and AI-driven platforms. Our Isaac Sim Benchmark Suite aims to set the standard for evaluating autonomous systems in complex, real-world scenarios.

### Computer Vision
From object detection to pose estimation, we're working on vision systems that can operate in challenging conditions - low light, degraded sensors, and unpredictable environments.

### Simulation & Testing
We leverage cutting-edge simulation platforms like NVIDIA Isaac Sim to train and test systems before deploying them to real hardware. This sim-to-real approach accelerates development and reduces costs.

### Robotics
Our projects span from warehouse automation to medical logistics, exploring how robotic systems can enhance both civilian and defense operations.

## Our Approach

We're not just another research group. We're building a community that:

1. **Works in the Open**: All our projects are open-source and documented publicly
2. **Seeks Partnerships**: We actively collaborate with companies, universities, and government organizations
3. **Values Practicality**: Every project has clear deliverables and real-world applications
4. **Welcomes Contributors**: Whether you're a student or a seasoned professional, there's a place for you

## Current Projects

We're currently working on three exciting projects:

1. **Isaac Sim Benchmark Suite**: Standardized benchmarks for evaluating autonomous systems in dual-use scenarios
2. **Drone Surveillance Pipeline**: Sim-to-real transfer for drone perception in extreme conditions
3. **Robotic Arm for Medical Logistics**: Automated setup of field medical kits using computer vision

Each project has opportunities for collaboration at all levels.

## Get Involved

Interested in joining us? Here's how you can contribute:

- **Join a Project**: Browse our active projects and find one that matches your interests
- **Propose Ideas**: Have a dual-use tech idea? We'd love to hear it
- **Attend Meetups**: We host regular events in Munich (virtual options available)
- **Spread the Word**: Share our work with your network

## Looking Ahead

This is just the beginning. We're building something sustainable and impactful - a community that pushes the boundaries of what's possible in dual-use technology.

Whether you're interested in AI, robotics, simulation, or any related field, ARC Munich offers a platform to work on meaningful projects with talented collaborators.

Welcome aboard!
