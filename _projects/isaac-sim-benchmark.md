## Overview

Creating standardized Isaac Sim benchmarks for dual-use scenarios to establish leadership in evaluation methodology for autonomous systems.

## Goal

Create standardized Isaac Sim benchmarks for dual-use scenarios to establish leadership in evaluation methodology. This project aims to set the standard for how autonomous systems are evaluated in both civilian and defense contexts.

## Benchmark Scenarios

We have designed 10 comprehensive benchmark scenarios that span a wide range of dual-use applications:

### 1. Warehouse Coordination
Multi-robot task allocation and navigation in complex warehouse environments. Tests coordination, path planning, and collision avoidance in high-traffic scenarios.

### 2. Disaster Response
Search and rescue operations in degraded environments with limited visibility, damaged infrastructure, and unpredictable conditions. Evaluates robustness and adaptability.

### 3. Security Patrol
Perimeter monitoring with anomaly detection capabilities. Tests long-duration autonomous operation, threat detection, and decision-making under uncertainty.

### 4. Infrastructure Inspection
Autonomous assessment of critical infrastructure including bridges, power lines, and pipelines. Evaluates precision navigation and defect detection.

### 5. Medical Logistics
Efficient delivery of medical supplies in hospital environments. Tests navigation in human-populated spaces and handling of sensitive cargo.

### 6. Agricultural Automation
Crop monitoring and harvesting coordination across large agricultural areas. Evaluates multi-agent coordination and environmental adaptation.

### 7. Urban Search
Navigation in GPS-denied city environments with complex urban geometry. Tests SLAM capabilities and resilience to sensor limitations.

### 8. Hazardous Material Handling
Safe manipulation of dangerous materials in controlled conditions. Evaluates precise manipulation and safety protocol compliance.

### 9. Border Surveillance
Long-range monitoring and classification of objects and activities. Tests persistent surveillance capabilities and data processing.

### 10. Emergency Evacuation
Crowd management and guidance during emergency scenarios. Evaluates human-robot interaction and dynamic replanning.

## Deliverables

- **10 Standardized Isaac Sim Scenarios**: Detailed documentation, evaluation metrics, baseline implementations, and difficulty variations for each scenario
- **Automated Evaluation Framework**: Comprehensive testing and scoring system that can be run on any submission
- **Public Leaderboard Website**: Real-time rankings and submission portal for the research community
- **Baseline Algorithm Suite**: Including rule-based approaches, classical planning methods, RL baselines, and hybrid approaches

## Collaboration Opportunities

We're actively seeking collaborators interested in:

- Scenario Design and Validation
- Baseline Algorithm Development
- Evaluation Metric Definition
- Testing and Benchmarking
- Documentation and Tutorials
- Web Platform Development

## Technical Details

The benchmark suite will be built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, leveraging its physics simulation, sensor simulation, and robotics capabilities. All scenarios will be open-source and reproducible, with standardized APIs for algorithm submissions.

## Impact

This project will establish a standard for evaluating autonomous systems in dual-use contexts, accelerating research and development in both civilian and defense applications. By providing clear benchmarks, we enable objective comparison of different approaches and drive progress in the field.
